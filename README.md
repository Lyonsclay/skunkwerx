**Skunkwerx Performance LLC** Complete specialized care for your TDI diesel powered VW or Audi now on the web.

Developer: [Lyonsclay](http://wonkitnow.tumblr.com).

Maintenance free solutions:)

## Built With

Ruby (2.1.1)

Rails (4.0.2)

**Skunkwerx Performance** This app has been built for Skunkwerx Performance Automotive LLC. It serves the purpose of providing a basic customer interface for arranging automotive service and web sales for products related to performance enhancement.

I have used this app as an opportunity to practice skills I have learned at **Dev Bootcamp** Chicago. In principal I have opted for as many hand made solutions as possible. I tried to cut down on the number of external dependecies and tried to focus on learning root technology and not how to use specific gems. When that didn't seem advisable I used gems or frameworks that were high profile and proven solutions.

There is an extensive admin portal encoded in it's own namespace. This is a custom built solution that has high integration with **Freshbooks** accounting and a scraper that gathers products from a partner website and includes them in Skunkwerx listed products.

All products listed by Skunkwerx are backed by the Freshbooks database and integration with the Skunkwerx postgres ActiveRecord database is a key feature of this web app. The process gives the product owner the ability to manage product actions through the Freshbooks website interface. The Skunkwerx webapp subscribes to any updates( webhooks ) in Fresbooks products creating parity between the two databases.

## Installation

Run the following command to install it:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Lyonsclay/skunkwerx.git
```

Run the basic tests:

```console
rspec
```

```console
rake test
```

Run tests that make api call:

```console
API=run rspec
```

Run tests that implement webhooks with Freshbooks API:

```console
WEBHOOKS=run rspec
```

Testing is everything and I continue to strive for TDD, BDD, and 100% test coverage. I utilized both rspec and testunit to get a feel for both processes. I found testunit easier to use and learn, but rspec had additional features that allowed me to flag tests that were making live calls to websites, apis, and even the deployed Skunkwerx app.

I made the perhaps unusual decision to place certain methods that perform integration with the clientâ€™s Freshbooks account through their public API into the rspec test suite. Rather than give certain admin users roles to define their access to methods it felt natural to place these actions  out of the mvp venue and closer to the heart of maintenance( testing ) that the developer alone has access to and utility of. This also allows me to run a few tests from a local environment in order to easily monitor the health of the overall app.

In the instance of a webhook request there is the call, the response, and then a verification routine. The call is being made from the local machine through an rspec test. However, the response and verification routine are being directed at app's deployed domain name skunkwerx-performance.com. I discovered that the test of a response actually occurred before the verification routine completed and therefore gave a false result to tests that relied on the verification. I embedded a routine to

## Gems

For parsing external websites:

'nokogiri' 'rexml' 'http' 'uri'

###For making api calls and reading responses:

The admin/freshbooks_helper method contains a full set of commands for interacting with the Freshbooks API including the implementation of webhooks. This particular file feels a bit heavy to be sitting in the core app's mvp logic. I would prefer that this was abstracted into a gem that had it's own maintenance and testing. It also would be nice to have a class designated for Freshbooks calls that followed a similar pattern to that of net/http.

[Freshbooks API](http://developers.freshbooks.com)

The following is the basic call method to the Freshbooks API which lives in app/helpers/admin/freshbooks_helper.rb.

```ruby
  def freshbooks_call(message)
    uri = URI.parse(ENV['FRESHBOOKS_URL'])
    http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
    http.use_ssl = true
    request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri)
    request.basic_auth ENV['FRESHBOOKS_KEY'], 'X'
    request.body = message
    response = http.request(request)
  end
```

Incidentally, I chose to use  REXML, a pure Ruby XML processor, xpath, hash, and css methods for parsing http responses and web templates. My intent was to experiment with different technologies and learn them. In conclusion I've found hash methods to be the easiest and xpath to be the most efficient for parsing. I am considering converting other techniques to xpath for efficiency and uniformity.

Of particular concern is the reliance on a css hiearchy that the scraper functionality in malone_tunes relies upon. If any changes to their page structure occur the functionality is useless. While I have planned on that inevitability I want to minimizes the losses by using attribute names that xpath can find recursively.

###For production on Heroku:

'unicorn' 'rails_12factor' 'dalli'

###For image management:

'paperclip' 'aws-dk'

###For testing:

'rspec' 'capybara' 'factorygirl'

## Styles

Namespaceing assets and utilizing style method. Hand made css solutions.

**Simple Form** can be easily integrated to the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
To do that you have to use the `bootstrap` option in the install generator, like this:

```console
rails generate simple_form:install --bootstrap
```

You have to be sure that you added a copy of the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
assets on your application.

For more information see the generator output, our
[example application code](https://github.com/rafaelfranca/simple_form-bootstrap) and
[the live example app](http://simple-form-bootstrap.plataformatec.com.br/).

## Conclusion

What remains to be implemented is the functionality of a shopping cart and integration with PayPal and perhaps another payment service down the line.

Then there is getting 100% test coverage whatever that means.
